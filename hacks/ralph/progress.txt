# Ralph Progress Log
Started: Fri Jan 23 10:17:36 UTC 2026
## Codebase Patterns
- External.RancherHttpClient.auth_validation can return {:error, reason}; handle both :error and {:error, _} in callers.

## Fri Jan 23 10:27:28 UTC 2026 - US-001
- Added rr list command that fetches clusters once and renders a NAME/ID table with empty-state messaging
- Files changed: lib/cmds/list.ex, lib/rr.ex, test/rr/list_test.exs, lib/config/auth.ex, hacks/ralph/prd.json, hacks/ralph/progress.txt
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Patterns discovered: External.RancherHttpClient.auth_validation may return {:error, reason} (not only :error)
  - Gotchas encountered: mix format/test requires Elixir version from .tool-versions; main-otp-28 was unavailable locally
  - Useful context: rr help text lives in lib/rr.ex and is the right spot to add new CLI commands
